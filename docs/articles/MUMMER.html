<p>This tutorial guides you through the process of performing genome
alignments using <a href="https://mummer4.github.io/index.html" class="external-link">MUMmer</a>, an alignment
tool widely used for comparing genomic sequences. As an example we will
align the plasmids from several species of <em>B. thuringiensis</em>.
Following the alignment, we’ll show you how to visualize the results
using <strong><code>geneviewer</code></strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="materials">Materials<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#materials"></a>
</h3>
<p>The .gbk files can be downloaded directly from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/" class="external-link">GenBank</a> using accession
numbers CP000486.1, CP009599.1, CP003188.1 and CP009638.1.
Alternatively, you can obtain the GenBank files including all alignment
files directly from the <a href="https://github.com/nvelden/geneviewer-tutorials/tree/main/MUMmer%20alignments" class="external-link">geneviewer-tutorials</a>
repository.</p>

<p>MUMmer needs to be installed on your local machine to execute
alignments. For detailed installation instructions, visit the <a href="https://mummer4.github.io/install/install.html" class="external-link">MUMmer
website</a>. Once MUMmer is installed, you can perform the alignment
using <code>geneviewer</code> with the <code><a href="../reference/mummer_alignment.html">mummer_alignment()</a></code>
function. By default it will run the alignment in order of the files in
the folder.</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong> MUMmer requires file paths without
spaces.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="kw"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html" class="external-link">library</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va"><a href="https://github.com/nvelden/geneviewer" class="external-link">geneviewer</a></span><span class="op">)</span></span>

<span><span class="va">folder_path</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="st">"~/path/to/folder/"</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>By default, the <code><a href="../reference/mummer_alignment.html">mummer_alignment()</a></code> function will perform
pair wise alignments starting with the first file in the folder. To
adjust the order in which files are aligned, assign a vector of file
names to the <code>cluster</code> variable. By default nucleotide
sequences are translated into proteins using “promer” and a
“many-to-many” mapping alignment is performed. For the most suitable
alignment method for your project, please carefully review the <a href="https://mummer4.github.io/index.html" class="external-link">MUMmer</a> documentation. To
learn how to modify the default settings, consult the documentation by
running <code>?mummer_alignment()</code>.</p>

<p>The alignment generates a data frame that details the start and end
positions of each aligned region between the reference (cluster1) and
query (cluster2), along with identity and similarity scores. This data
frame can be directly loaded into the <code><a href="../reference/GC_links.html">GC_links()</a></code>
function.</p>

<p>We can load the cluster data into the <code><a href="../reference/GC_chart.html">GC_chart()</a></code> and the
alignment data into the <code><a href="../reference/GC_links.html">GC_links()</a></code> function. In addition,
we change the axis_type to “range”, make the genes a little smaller and
add cluster labels. For more customization options see <a href="https://nvelden.github.io/geneviewer/articles/geneviewer.html">Get

<p><strong>Important</strong>: The gene cluster data like the alignment
data is loaded in the order of the files in the folder. If a custom
order was used for the MUMer alignment make sure to sort the “cluster”
column in the cluster data in the same way.</p>
